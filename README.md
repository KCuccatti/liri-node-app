# liri-node-app

This project is a LIRI bot, like SIRI, that takes in user commands and provides user data based on those commands. 
The bot is capable of pulling information about movies, songs and concerts without needing to go to multiple sources. 
To get started, open the app in Visual Studio Code and make sure your terminal is set to the right path. Type "node liri" 
without the quotes in the terminal. This will show the user how to access the functionalities of LIRI.

The test cases I used can be viewed in the log.txt or the readme inside app. I did not do screen shots or make a video to show how the app works as I elected to have the application write data to file as well as the commands used to get that data. The results and the commands used to get those results can be viewed in the file ('log.txt'). 
Enjoy!
